SkeletAge is an aging clock designed to predict biological age using transcriptomic data from skeletal muscle tissue. Its main goal is to be able to identify the **ageprint**â€”a tissue-specific set of genes that regulate baseline healthy aging.

## ðŸ§¬ **Skeletome Database**  

SkeletAge was developed using **Skeletome**, a comprehensive database of 534 skeletal muscle RNA-seq samples. Skeletome contains:  
- Raw counts aligned to **GRCh38**  
- Metadata with accurate age labels  
- Samples from 19 to 90 years of age across 11 studies
